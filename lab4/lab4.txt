1- Create an array method that calculates the average for an array of numbers.
    ex: var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        arr.average() // should return the average
    Note: Handle validation

2- When trying to convert an object to string, the output is always '[object object]'.
  a- Change the default output for all objects to be 'This is an object'.
    ex: 
        var obj = {};
        String(obj); // Output: 'This is an object'.

  b- Make String(obj) of only the following object return the content of the message while the all other objects still return 'This is an object'.
        var obj = { message: 'This is a message' };
        String(obj) // Output: 'This is a message'.

3- You're tasked with modeling vehicles and cars in a transportation app:
    - A Vehicle has type and speed properties.
    - All vehicles can start and stop methods.
    - A Car inherits from Vehicle and has an additional drive method.

    a- Implement this using ES5 function constructors
     - Limit the number of Vehicle instances to 50. If an attempt is made to create the 51st vehicle, throw an error with the message: 'Vehicle limit reached'.
     - the implementation of the methods can be console.log only or you can leave them empty
 
    b- Write a function that checks whether an object is an instance of Car using two different ways
